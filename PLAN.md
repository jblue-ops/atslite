## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branches for each phase/sub-phase
- Use descriptive commit messages with conventional commits
- Create PRs for each major feature set
- Maintain clean git history with rebasing when appropriate

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests for all new functionality (models, controllers, services)
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Use RSpec for unit and integration tests
- Use Capybara for system/feature tests
- Use FactoryBot for test data generation

### Code Quality
- Follow Rails conventions and best practices
- Use RuboCop for code style enforcement
- Use Brakeman for security scanning
- Implement service objects for complex business logic
- Use form objects for complex multi-model forms

### Documentation
- Update this PLAN.md as phases are completed
- Maintain CLAUDE.md with project context
- Document complex business logic and decisions
- Create API documentation as features are added

## Phase Completion Checklist

For each phase, ensure:
- [ ] All planned features are implemented
- [ ] Tests are written and passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Code is linted and follows style guidelines
- [ ] Security scan passes (Brakeman)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] PR is created and reviewed
- [ ] Phase is merged to main branch
- [ ] This PLAN.md is updated with completion status

## Notes

- Each phase should be completable in 1-3 development sessions
- Phases can be split into smaller PRs if they become too large
- Some phases may be developed in parallel (e.g., reporting while building core features)
- User feedback should be incorporated between phases when possible
- Performance optimization should be considered throughout development
